# FFA Framework Wiki

Welcome to the FFA Framework wiki!

The FFA Framework is an open-source project for **Flood Frequency Analysis** (FFA) developed by researchers at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada.
The framework is currently available as an R package and a command line interface (CLI).

The [original version](https://zenodo.org/records/8012096) of this software was written in MATLAB and published as [A practice-oriented framework for stationary and nonstationary flood frequency analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.105940) (Vidrio-Sahag√∫n et al. 2024). For a list of changes from the MATLAB version, see [here](matlab-version.md).

- To get started with the R package, see the [installation instructions](r-installation-instructions.md) and [documentation](r-user-manual.pdf).
- To get started with the CLI, please read the [installation instructions](cli-installation-instructions.md) and the [user manual](cli-user-manual.md).
