# Installation Instructions

The FFA framework is currently available as a command line interface (CLI) for the `R` programming environment.
Therefore, installation and usage of the framework will require modellers to be familiar with the shell on their respective operating system.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads. 
2. Check that Git is installed by executing `git --version` in a shell.
3. Install R from https://www.r-project.org/. Version 4.5.0 is recommended.
4. Check that R is installed by executing `R --version` in  a shell.  
5. Install the latest version of Pandoc from https://pandoc.org/.
6. Check that Pandoc is installed by executing `pandoc --version` in a shell.

### A Note for Windows Users

You may need to add Git, R and Pandoc to your path in order to run them from the command line.
To do this, you will need to edit your system environment variables from the settings menu.
The default paths for Git, R and Pandoc are:

```
C:\Program Files\Git\bin
C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.0\bin
C:\Program Files\Pandoc
```

## Installing the FFA Framework 

### Part 1: Installing the CLI

1. Open a shell and navigate to the directory where you would like to install the framework.
2. Clone the Github repository by running the following command in a shell:

        git clone https://github.com/rileywheadon/ffa-framework.git

3. Navigate to the `source` directory. This directory contains a `renv.lock` file.
4. Open a command prompt with `R`. The `renv` package should install automatically.
5. Load libraries from the `renv.lock` file by executing `renv::restore()`.
6. Exit the command prompt with `q()`.

### Part 2: Installing the `ffaframework` Package

The FFA framework requires this [R package](https://github.com/rileywheadon/ffa-package).
To install it,

1. Open a shell and navigate to the directory where you would like to install the package.
2. Clone the Github repository by running the following command in a shell:

        git clone https://github.com/rileywheadon/ffa-package.git

3. Navigate to the `source` directory of the CLI installed in Part 1.
4. Open a command prompt with `R`. Install the `devtools` package: 

        install.packages("devtools")
        library(devtools)

5. Run the following command, changing `~/path/to/ffa-package` as needed. 

        devtools::install("~/path/to/ffa-package")

6. Exit the command prompt with `q()`. The installation is complete.
