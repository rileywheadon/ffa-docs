Welcome to the FFA Framework wiki!

The FFA Framework is an open-source project for **Flood Frequency Analysis** (FFA) developed by researchers at the University of Calgary, Canada[^1].
The framework is currently available as an R package and a command line interface (CLI).

- To get started with the R package, please read the [documentation](r-documentation.pdf).
- To get started with the CLI, please read the [installation instructions](cli-installation.md) and the [user manual](cli-manual.md).
