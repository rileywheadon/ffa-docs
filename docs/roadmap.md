# Roadmap

## CRAN Package

### In Development

- Developing workflow functions:
    - `module_eda` for exploratory data analysis.
    - `module_ffa` for flood frequency analysis.
    - `ffaframework` for the complete framework.
- Testing the package in preparation for submission to CRAN.

### Known Issues

- Sample bootstrap yields unusually large CIs for nonstationary models.
- RFPL breaks on some stations (i.e. Lake Louise, station ID `05BA001`).

## Web Interface

We hope to finish a web interface for the FFA framework by September 2025.
