# Getting Started

First, you will need to install the CLI. Installation instructions can be found [here](cli-installation-instructions.md).

The FFA Framework CLI consists of a single script, `ffaframework.R`.
This script runs exploratory data analysis and/or flood frequency analysis on one or many datasets. 
It can also produce a report as a markdown, PDF, HTML, or JSON file.
To configure the CLI, simply edit `config.yml`.
See the [user manual](cli-user-manual.md) for more information.

## Folder Structure

The `/data` folder contains CSV files used by the CLI.
The following files are included by default:

- `Application_1.csv`: Station 07BE001 (Athabasca River at Athabasca)
- `Application_2.csv`: Station 08NH021 (Kootenai River at Porthill)
- `Application_3_1.csv`: Station 05BB001 (Bow River at Banff)
- `Application_3_2.csv`: Station 08MH016 (Chilliwack River at Chilliwack Lake)
- `Application_3_3.csv`: Station 08NM050 (Okanagan River at Penticton)

The `/reports` folder stores reports and images generated by the CLI.

## Trying the Framework

By default, the CLI does an analysis of `Application_1.csv`.
Give it a try by navigating to the `ffa-framework` folder in a terminal and running the command `Rscript ffaframework.R`.

## What Next?

We recommend reading the documents in the "Exploratory Data Analysis" and "Flood Frequency Analysis" sidebars to familiarize yourself with the statistical techniques used in the FFA Framework.
Once you're comfortable with the ideas, try running another flood frequency analysis on one of the example datasets!
