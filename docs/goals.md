# Goals

[Vidrio-Sahag√∫n et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2025.2462603) identified a number of issues with FFA research in Canada. Our framework aims to address these issues. In particular, we hope to achieve:

- **Standardization**: The United States uses a standardized distribution (LP3) and parameter estimation method (expected moments) for FFA. However, Canada does not provide such guidance. By developing this framework, we hope to limit subjectivity in flood estimation.
- **Reproducibility**: Many FFA studies in Canada do not provide essential information for reproduction, such information about exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed, the distribution selection mechanism, and even the probability distribution itself. 
- **Statistical Rigour**: Historically, many FFA studies have not performed uncertainty quantification, which makes it difficult to draw accurate conclusion from the results. Our framework automatically performs uncertainty analysis to quantify potential errors.
- **Research-to-Practice Translation**: The disorganization of FFA research in Canada makes it difficult for regulatory agencies to access cutting-edge advancements in FFA methodologies. By providing a common set of techniques for modellers to use, we hope to bridge the gap between research and practice. 

Development is guided by the following principles:

- **Software Freedom**: Our framework is built on free and open source software.
- **Modularity**: Users are allowed to use as much or as little of the framework as they like.
- **Interoperability**: Our framework can be seamlessly integrated with other flood models.
- **Flexibility**: Users can tailor their analysis to the nuances of individual watersheds.
- **Clarity**: The source code is easy to read and understand.
- **Robustness**: The framework can handle datasets with small sample sizes or missing values.
