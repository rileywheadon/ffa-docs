# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA module in the FFA Framework helps evaluate whether the available evidence supports the assumption of stationarity. EDA detects statistically significant nonstationary signatures in a given annual maximum series (AMS). 
EDA applies a structured sequence of statistical tests on AMS data to achieve four key objectives:

1. Detect **change points** (i.e., abrupt shifts or trend changes).
2. Detect **trends in the mean and their nature** (deterministic vs stochastic, linear vs non-linear, if any).
3. Detect **trends in the variability** (i.e., heteroskedasticity and trends in standard deviation).

***The primary goal of EDA is to inform the selection between stationary and nonstationary FFA.***

The EDA workflow is illustrated below:
