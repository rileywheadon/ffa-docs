# FFA Framework Wiki

The **FFA Framework** is an open-source tool for flood frequency analysis (FFA), designed to support systematic and repeatable workflows for stationary (S-FFA) and nonstationary (NS-FFA) analysis.
It is developed at the University of Calgary and the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, and is freely available to the public.

The framework is available as both an **R package** and a **command-line interface (CLI)**.
The [original version](https://zenodo.org/records/8012096) was released as a stand-alone GUI and MATLAB source code, published in [Vidrio-Sahagún et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.105940).
For details on changes from the MATLAB version, see [this page](matlab-version.md).
